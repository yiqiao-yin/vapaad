class VAPAAD:

    The VAPAAD model, short for Vision Augmentation Prediction Autoencoder with Attention Design,
    is a sophisticated neural network architecture tailored for video processing tasks. This model
    leverages a dual-encoder structure to process sequences of video frames for tasks such as
    video frame prediction and unsupervised learning. The unique aspect of this architecture is its
    stop gradient design, which effectively separates the learning phases of the two encoders, allowing
    one encoder to stabilize while the other continues to adapt during training.

    This architecture integrates data augmentation directly into the video processing pipeline,
    enhancing the model's ability to generalize across varied video data. It employs self-attention
    mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies within the video sequences, thereby enhancing its
    predictive capabilities.
